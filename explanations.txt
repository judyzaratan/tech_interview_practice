Question 1

Time complexity: O(n)
It will need to iterate through the length of s, or t
Space complexity: 1
Temporary variable storage holding string

The function iterates through the complete s string and takes each character and does a check.
It checks if the character existing in s, is also in t and removes that character in t.
It then checks if it can possibly break out of the loop if we have encountered all characters in t.

The variable temp which serves as a counter to see if all of the characters have been exhausted.
If it hasn't in sequence, then it will reset back to the original string t.
